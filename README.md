How To Use:

After downloading the files, you can manually run the web application by starting up the IDE you want (we recommend VSCode).

1. Start up the MongoDB server (how you start it depends on how you downloaded MongoDB).
2. Go into the server folder and use the command "npm start" to start the server side.
3. Go into the client folder and use the command "npm start" to start the client side.

Note: You will need to do this on different terminals or windows for each side. You can also use Docker instead of starting up each server separately.
